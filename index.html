      <p> Hello! my name is Santiago and I'm a 16 years old high school student at CECyT 11 Wilfrido Massieu. I'm in the second
          semester of high school and  about to enter the third, aswell as entering a technical career. I chose construction as my
          career because I'm interested in architecture. But recently, thanks to a dear friend, I became interested in programming.
          So I started taking web development bootcamp as my first course and first serious interaction with the programming/coding/development
          world. I'm also keen in some sports, like basketball or tennis (even though I have never played this last one). This is a little about
          myself and the current state of my life, thanks for taking your time! </p>
